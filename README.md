Statistical exercises 1

This repository has only a few statistical exercises performed at the IAA graduate level. </br> </br>
## Here are some files: </br>
- Exercises.R contains the R script with exercise resolutions (and statements);
- ceo.txt and cpz91.txt are the data sets used for analysis;
- Two docx files with the column name descriptions in the data sets.

## Run: </br>
To run the scripts on your computer, just:
- clone this repository on your computer;
- open the Exercises.R script and change the file path `/cloud/project/` to your local file path;
- if you don't have any packages installed, run `install.packages("PACKAGE NAME")`;
- read the exercises and see the resolution :)
